Packet BRICKS is a Linux/FreeBSD daemon that is capable of receiving
and distributing ingress traffic to userland applications. Its main 
responsibilities may include (i) load-balancing, (ii) duplicating 
and/or (iii) filtering ingress traffic across all registered 
applications. The distribution is flow-aware (i.e. packets of one 
connection will always end up in the same application). At the moment,
pacet-bricks uses netmap packet I/O framework for receiving packets.
It employs netmap pipes to forward packets to end host applications. 

Before running packet-bricks, please make sure that you have
installed the netmap driver successfully. You should first try
running the sample pkt-gen binary (that is available in the netmap's
examples/) directory to see if the driver is operational. The netmap
module is continuously being updated with enhancements and bug fixes
(as is common for all open source tools including packet bricks). Before
using packet bricks, please make sure that you have downloaded and
updated the netmap kernel module with its latest version. Finally,
make sure that all netmap-enabled interfaces are set to promiscuous mode.

# sudo ifconfig eth3 promisc

The following guide provides a walkthrough of the scripts/startup-*.lua
files and also explains what this system is capable of.

User can start the program by running the following command:
# bin/bricks [-f startup_script_file]

To start the program as a daemon, either type:
# bin/bricks -d [-f startup_script_file]
		OR
# bin/bricks-server [-f startup_script_file]

If the system is executed as a non-daemon, it opens a 
LUA-based shell. Type the following command to print the help menu:
_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> BRICKS.help()
	BRICKS Commands:
    	    help()
    	    print_status()
    	    show_stats()
            shutdown()
          Available subsystems within BRICKS have their own help() methods:
          pkteng
_________________________________________________________________

Alternatively, the user can run `bricks-shell` to access the
interface shell to communicate with daemonized bricks-server.

You can hit Ctrl+D to exit the bricks-shell client. To gracefully
turn the daemon off, the user may enter the following command to 
exit the program:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> BRICKS.shutdown()
	Goodbye!
_________________________________________________________________

Packet bricks relies on netmap pipes to distribute traffic across
multiple applications. Some OSes have netmap pipes disabled by
default. Please use the following command to enable netmap pipes
(if needed) in a packet bricks session:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> utilObj:enable_nmpipes()
_________________________________________________________________

In packet-bricks, the most important component is the pkteng module.
It manages the reception and distribution of ingress traffic coming
through an interface. Once instantiated, the pkteng module spawns a 
thread that starts the packet reception process. After running 
packet-bricks again, use the following command to create a pkteng 
instance, pe:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe = PktEngine.new("e0")
_________________________________________________________________

The "e0" field is internally used by packet-bricks as pkteng's ID. 
You can delete the pkteng instance by running the following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:delete()
_________________________________________________________________

The pkteng instance can be instantiated with the possibility of
affinitizing the engine thread to an arbitrary cpu core id:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe = PktEngine.new("e0", 1024, 1)
_________________________________________________________________

The last parameter affinitizes the module to CPU 1 once the engine
thread starts reading packets.

In packet-bricks, ingress traffic can be manipulated with packet 
engine constructs called "bricks". Currently packet-bricks has 
the following built-in bricks that are available for use:

1- LoadBalancer: Brick that may be used to split flow-wise
   		 traffic to different applications using netmap 
		 pipes.

2- Duplicator: Brick that may be used to duplicate traffic
   	       across each registered netmap pipe.

3- Merge: Brick that may be used to combine traffic between
   	  2 or more netmap pipes.

4- Filter: UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

A packet engine can be linked to any of these bricks with
any combination/configuration of user's liking. Please see the
scripts/ example directory to see how bricks can be used to 
run variants of such packet engines.

The succeeding text uses a simple load balancing brick 
("LoadBalancer") to show how packet-bricks runs. A freshly
instantiated packet engine can be used to link the LoadBalancer
as:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> lb = Brick.new("LoadBalancer", 2)
	bricks> lb:connect_input("eth3")
	bricks> lb:connect_output("eth3{0", "eth3{1", 
				  "eth3{2", "eth3{3", "eth2")
	bricks> pe:link(lb)
_________________________________________________________________

This binds pkteng pe with LoadBalancer brick and asks the system 
to read ingress packets from eth3 and split them flow-wise based on 
the 2-tuple (src & dst IP addresses) metadata of the packet header.
The "lb:connect_output(...)" command creates four netmap-specific 
pipes named "netmap:eth3{x" where 0 <= x < 4 and an egress 
interface named "eth2". The traffic is evenly split between all five
channels based on the 2 tuple header as previously mentioned. 
Userland applications can now use packet-bricks to get their fair 
share of ingress traffic. The brick is finally linked with the 
packet engine.

One can always unlink the brick by running the following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:unlink()
_________________________________________________________________

If the user is content with the packet engine setup, he/she can
bypass unlinking and start the engine:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:start()
_________________________________________________________________

The engine will start sniffing for packets from the interface 
promiscuously. You can use the following command to get the run-time
packets-related statistics from the engine:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe.show_stats()
_________________________________________________________________

Sample applications (e.g. tcpdump) can read ingress traffic from 
packet-bricks using following command line arguments:
_________________________________________________________________
	$ sudo tcpdump -i netmap:eth3}0 &
	$ sudo tcpdump -i netmap:eth3}1 &
	$ sudo tcpdump -i netmap:eth3}2 &
	$ sudo tcpdump -i netmap:eth3}3 &
_________________________________________________________________

Please note that you cannot unlink a brick from the pkteng
while the engine is running. To stop the engine, please run the 
following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:stop()
_________________________________________________________________


For user's convenience, the packet-bricks package comes with a 
reference LUA script file: please see scripts/startup-*.lua files for
details. You can also use the following command to load the script
file in packet-bricks at startup:

# bin/bricks -f scripts/startup-one-thread.lua, OR
# bin/bricks-server -f scripts/startup-one-thread.lua

The user is recommended to skim through the script file. It is
heavily documented. The scripts directory also contains code for 
running a 4-threaded version of the pkteng (see 
scripts/startup-multi-threads.lua).

=======================================================================
NOTE: Please install the required libraries mentioned in INSTALL file.
As the system is still under active development, the program may
exhibit unexpected behavior if libraries are not installed.

The README file in the netmap/ directory contains pointers
on how to enhance packet I/O performance. We suggest you to follow
their guide for extracting maximum performance out of packet
bricks as well.
