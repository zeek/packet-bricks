Packet BRICKS is a Linux/FreeBSD daemon that is capable of receiving
and distributing ingress traffic to userland applications. Its main 
responsibilities may include (i) load-balancing, (ii) duplicating 
and/or (iii) filtering ingress traffic across all registered 
applications. The distribution is flow-aware (i.e. packets of one 
connection will always end up in the same application). At the moment,
pacet-bricks uses netmap packet I/O framework for receiving packets.
It employs netmap pipes to forward packets to end host applications. 

The following guide provides a walkthrough of the scripts/startup-*.lua
files and also explains what this system is capable of.

User can start the program by running the following command:
# bin/bricks [-f startup_script_file]

To start the program as a daemon, either type:
# bin/bricks -d [-f startup_script_file]
		OR
# bin/bricks-server [-f startup_script_file]

If the system is executed as a non-daemon, it opens a 
LUA-based shell. Type the following command to print the help menu:
_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> BRICKS.help()
	BRICKS Commands:
    	    help()
    	    print_status()
    	    show_stats()
            shutdown()
          Available subsystems within BRICKS have their own help() methods:
          pkteng
_________________________________________________________________

Alternatively, the user can run `bricks-shell` to access the
interface shell to communicate with daemonized bricks-server.

You can hit Ctrl+D to exit the bricks-shell client. To gracefully
turn the daemon off, the user may enter the following command to 
exit the program:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> BRICKS.shutdown()
	Goodbye!
_________________________________________________________________


In packet-bricks, the most important component is the pkteng module.
It manages the reception and distribution of ingress traffic coming
thru an interface. Once instantiated, the pkteng module spawns a 
threads that starts the packet reception process. After running 
packet-bricks again, use the following command to create a pkteng 
instance, pe:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe = PktEngine.new("e0", "netmap")
_________________________________________________________________

The "e0" field is internally used by packet-bricks as pkteng's ID. 
You can delete the pkteng instance by running the following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:delete()
_________________________________________________________________

The pkteng instance can be instantiated with the possibility of
affinitizing the engine thread to an arbitrary cpu core id:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe = PktEngine.new("e0", "netmap", 1024, 1)
_________________________________________________________________

The last parameter affinitizes the module to CPU 1 once the engine
thread starts reading packets.

In packet-bricks, ingress traffic can be manipulated with packet 
engine constructs called "bricks". Currently packet-bricks has 
the following built-in bricks that are available for use:

1- LoadBalancer: Brick that may be used to split flow-wise
   		 traffic to different applications using netmap 
		 pipes.

2- Duplicator: Brick that may be used to duplicate traffic
   	       across each registered netmap pipe.

3- Merge: Brick that may be used to combine traffic between
   	  2 or more netmap pipes.

4- Filter: UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

A packet engine can be linked to any of these bricks with
any combination/configuration of user's liking. Please see the
scripts/ example directory to see how bricks can be used to 
run variants of such packet engines.

The succeeding text uses a simple load balancing brick 
("LoadBalancer") to show how packet-bricks runs. A freshly
instantiated packet engine can be used to link the LoadBalancer
as:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> local lb = Brick.new("LoadBalancer", 2)
	bricks> lb.connect_input("eth3")
	bricks> lb:connect_output("eth3{0", "eth3{1", 
				  "eth3{2", "eth3{3", "eth2")
	bricks> pe:link(lb)
_________________________________________________________________

This binds pkteng pe with LoadBalancer brick and asks the system 
to read ingress packets from eth3 and split them flow-wise based on 
the 2-tuple (src & dst IP addresses) metadata of the packet header.
The "lb:connect_output(...)" command creates four netmap-specific 
pipes named "netmap:eth3{x" where 0 <= x < 4 and an egress 
interface named "eth2". The traffic is evenly split between all five
channels based on the 2 tuple header as previously mentioned. 
Userland applications can now use packet-bricks to get their fair 
share of ingress traffic. The brick is finally linked with the 
packet engine.

One can always unlink the brick by running the following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:unlink()
_________________________________________________________________

If the user is content with the packet engine setup, he/she can
bypass unlinking and start the engine:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:start()
_________________________________________________________________

The engine will start sniffing for packets from the interface 
promiscuously. You can use the following command to get the run-time
packets-related statistics from the engine:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe.show_stats()
_________________________________________________________________

Please note that you cannot unlink an brick from the pkteng
while the engine is running. To stop the engine, please run the 
following command:

_________________________________________________________________
	bricks> pe:stop()
_________________________________________________________________


For user's convenience, the packet-bricks package comes with a 
reference LUA script file: please see scripts/startup-*.lua files for
details. You can also use the following command to load the script
file in packet-bricks at startup:

# bin/bricks -f scripts/startup-one-thread.lua, OR
# bin/bricks-server -f scripts/startup-one-thread.lua

The user is recommended to skim through the script file. It is
heavily documented. The scripts directory also contains code for 
running a 4-threaded version of the pkteng (see 
scripts/startup-multi-threads.lua).

=======================================================================
NOTE: Please install the required libraries mentioned in INSTALL file.
As the system is still under active development, the program may
exhibit unexpected behavior if libraries are not installed.
